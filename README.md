# Front End Development Kit
### By Arfian Adam

Front end web development kit made by me using automated build tools to bootstrap simple and static html page.

## Installation
1. Install the dependencies

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
2. Run the dev server and the browser will auto reload as you make changes

  ```shell
  npm start
  ```
